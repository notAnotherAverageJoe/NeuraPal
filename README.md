Handwritten Digit Recognition with Neural Networks
Overview
The neural network we trained specializes in recognizing handwritten digits. It assesses its proficiency in identifying digits from 0 to 9 by analyzing the pixel values of input images.

Training Phase
Training Process:

The neural network adjusts its internal weights and biases during the training phase.
It learns from thousands of labeled examples, consisting of images of handwritten digits along with their respective labels.
The loss function quantifies the disparity between predictions and actual labels, guiding the optimizer to minimize this deviation.
Testing Phase
Evaluation Procedure:

Post-training, we assess the model's performance using a separate dataset (the test set).
The test set comprises images that the model has never encountered.
The model predicts the label for each test image and contrasts it with the actual label.
Test accuracy, indicating the percentage of correct predictions, gauges the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.
Generalization
Achieving Generalization:

The aim is for the model to excel not only on the training data but also on the test data, which it hasn't encountered during training.
High accuracy on the test set signifies good generalization, suggesting the model's proficiency in recognizing digits it hasn't explicitly learned.
Summary
In essence, the neural network undergoes rigorous testing to accurately recognize handwritten digits. The higher its performance on the test set, the greater our confidence in its efficacy for real-world digit recognition tasks. ðŸ¤–ðŸ”¢
