he neural network we trained is testing its ability to classify handwritten digits. Specifically, itâ€™s evaluating how well it can recognize the digits from 0 to 9 based on the pixel values of the input images.

Training Phase:
During training, the neural network learns to adjust its internal weights and biases.
It sees thousands of labeled examples (images of handwritten digits along with their corresponding labels) and learns to map the pixel values to the correct digit labels.
The loss function measures how far off the predictions are from the actual labels. The optimizer then adjusts the modelâ€™s parameters to minimize this loss.
Testing Phase:
After training, we evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using a separate set of data (the test set).
The test set contains images that the model has never seen before.
The model makes predictions for each test image and compares them to the true labels.
The accuracy (percentage of correct predictions) on the test set tells us how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data.
Generalization:
The goal is for the model to perform well on both the training data (which it has seen during training) and the test data (which it hasnâ€™t seen).
If the model achieves high accuracy on the test set, it indicates good generalizationâ€”meaning it can recognize digits it hasnâ€™t explicitly learned.
In summary, the neural network is being tested on its ability to recognize handwritten digits accurately. The better it performs on the test set, the more confident we are in its ability to handle real-world digit recognition tasks. ðŸ¤–ðŸ”¢
